Fionn's Petitions
CT5171 -CA Assignment
This project is a simple, interactive Spring Boot web application that allows users to create, search, view, and sign public petitions. Using a user-friendly interface built with Thymeleaf templates, anyone can generate a new petition by entering a petition title, their name, and an email address. All petitions are stored temporarily in memory using Java lists, allowing the site to instantly display active petitions without requiring a database. Users can browse all existing petitions, search for a specific one by its unique ID, and open detailed petition pages that display creator information and a growing list of signatures.

The platform also supports full petition interaction through a built-in signing system. Once a user finds a petition—either through the search function or the petitions list—they can submit their name and email to sign the petition, which is instantly added to the petition’s public signature list. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of Spring MVC, form processing, model management, and dynamic page rendering with Thymeleaf, making it a straightforward but effective example of how user-generated content and dynamic data can be managed within a Java web application.
